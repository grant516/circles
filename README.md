# Overview

This C# program is a circle calculator. The user enters a number of circles they would like and then they proceed to add a radius for each circle. Once completed, the program will find both the area and volume for each of these circles. At this point, the programs promts the user asking If they would like to compare two circles. If the user says yes, the program will compare two circles that the user chooses and displays how many of one circle can fit inside the other. The program will display this information for both area and volume.

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}

This software was to help me understand the syntax for C#. It helped me learn about classes and the how and why of declaring variable types.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
